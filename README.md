# ramda-lenses

A simple example repo regarding how to use Lenses in JS with the Ramda library.

You should install the dependencies with:
`npm install`

And then run the js file with:
`node index.js`

If you are not willing to install anything and you're learning by simply reading the code, you may find this program output inside the "output.txt" file, just for convenience.
